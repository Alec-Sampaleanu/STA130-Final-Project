# STA130-Final-Project
Hazardous Driving Project for STA130

This project, the culminating one for STA130, involves analyzing Geotab data on hazardous driving. The goal of this project is to answer three questions:

1. Define what your group considers to be “hazardous driving” for the purposes of your project. Note that we expect that each group may have a different definition. The analysis your group does will follow from how you choose to define hazardous driving.

2. According to your definition of hazardous driving, which province has the most driving hazards?

3. How does hazardous driving in the province you identified in 2. compare to each of the other provinces?
